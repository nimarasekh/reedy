# Formalization of Reedy categories

As part of the workshop https://www.mittag-leffler.se/activities/formalizing-higher-categories/
the purpose of this project is to formalize the model category structure on the
category of functors from a Reedy category to a model category, following
the approach in sections C.4/C.5 of the book by Emily Riehl and
Dominic Verity *Elements of ∞-Category Theory* https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/elements.pdf

Goals:
1. very basic properties of Reedy categories (`Reedy.Basic`), the example of the simplex category (`Reedy.SimplexCategory`)
2. the skeleton filtration on the Yoneda functor `C ⥤ Cᵒᵖ ⥤ Type u` is a relative cell complex (`Reedy.RelativeCellComplex`)
3. study of the skeleton/coskeleton filtration on functors `C ⥤ D` (`Reedy.Skeleton`)
4. a weak factorization system on `D` gives a weak factorization system on `C ⥤ D` (`Reedy.WeakFactorizationSystem`)
5. the model category structure (`Reedy.ModelCategory`)

Required auxiliary API:
* Weighted (co)limits, which are required for 3./4./5.
* API for subfunctors are subbifunctors (some API for `SSet.Subcomplex` should be generalized for `Subfunctor`, and a similar API needs to be developed for `Subfunctor₂`)
